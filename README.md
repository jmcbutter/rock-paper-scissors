## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - React Component Library

### What I learned

The design of this project was interesting and fun to build. The box shadows gave a feeling of depth to the buttons, and I added an animation that "spun" the computer's selection to help create a more game-like experience.

This project also gave me more experience with React, and I'm becoming much more comfortable with passing state around and modifying it with callbacks.
